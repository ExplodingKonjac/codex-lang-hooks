## Module Breakdown

| Module | Responsibility | Key files |
|--------|----------------|-----------|
| Marketplace | Declares locally available plugins and installation policy. | `.agents/plugins/marketplace.json` |
| Plugin generator | Copies the language template, rewrites plugin metadata, and appends marketplace entries. | `scripts/create_language_hook_plugin.py` |
| Language template | Minimal plugin skeleton for future language hook packages. | `templates/language-hook-template/` |
| C++ plugin manifest | Describes the C++ hook plugin and its hook registrations. | `plugins/cpp-lang-hooks/.codex-plugin/plugin.json`, `plugins/cpp-lang-hooks/hooks/hooks.json` |
| Hook common utilities | Parse hook input, collect edited file paths, find CMake project/build directories, and emit hook responses. | `plugins/cpp-lang-hooks/scripts/common/hook.mjs` |
| C++ post-edit hook | Runs `clang-format` and `clang-tidy` on edited C/C++ files and marks turn state. | `plugins/cpp-lang-hooks/scripts/post_edit_hook.mjs` |
| C++ stop hook | Runs `cmake --build` and `ctest` for CMake projects only when state says the current turn changed C/C++ files. | `plugins/cpp-lang-hooks/scripts/stop_hook.mjs` |
| C++ turn state | Stores per-turn C/C++ change flags in SQLite under `PLUGIN_DATA`. | `plugins/cpp-lang-hooks/scripts/common/turn_state.mjs` |

## Data Flow

1. A Codex edit tool triggers the C++ plugin `PostToolUse` hook.
2. `collectHookFilePaths()` extracts edited paths from `tool_input` or `apply_patch` content.
3. Any mentioned C/C++ path records the turn as changed for `input.turn_id`; only paths that still exist are formatted and linted.
4. A Codex `Stop` event invokes `stop_hook.mjs`.
5. The stop hook reads SQLite turn state. If the current turn definitely has no C/C++ changes, it skips CMake checks; otherwise it selects the first supported build directory, runs `cmake --build`, then runs `ctest`.

## Design Patterns

- Template Method style scaffolding: `create_language_hook_plugin.py` copies a fixed template and rewrites known metadata fields.
- Fail-open hook state: if `PLUGIN_DATA`, `turn_id`, or SQLite access is unavailable, the stop hook runs `ctest` rather than silently trusting missing state.
- Local host tool delegation: hooks call external C++ tools when installed and silently skip missing optional tools.
- Ordered CMake build discovery: hooks prefer `build/`, `cmake-build-debug/`, `cmake-build-release/`, then `out/build/` when those directories contain CMake marker files.

## Security Boundaries

- Hook scripts execute local commands (`clang-format`, `clang-tidy`, `cmake`, `ctest`) against repository files, so they should keep arguments structured and avoid shell interpolation.
- Plugin state is stored only under `PLUGIN_DATA`; repository files are not used for runtime hook state.
- The generator writes to `plugins/` and `.agents/plugins/marketplace.json`; it validates plugin names and JSON object shapes before writing.
