## Module Breakdown

| Module | Responsibility | Key files |
|--------|----------------|-----------|
| Marketplace | Declares locally available plugins and installation policy. | `.agents/plugins/marketplace.json` |
| Plugin generator | Copies the language template, rewrites plugin metadata, and appends marketplace entries. | `scripts/create_language_hook_plugin.py` |
| Language template | Minimal plugin skeleton for future language hook packages. | `templates/language-hook-template/` |
| C++ plugin manifest | Describes the C++ hook plugin and its hook registrations. | `plugins/cpp-lang-hooks/.codex-plugin/plugin.json`, `plugins/cpp-lang-hooks/hooks/hooks.json` |
| Rust plugin manifest | Describes the Rust hook plugin and its hook registrations. | `plugins/rust-lang-hooks/.codex-plugin/plugin.json`, `plugins/rust-lang-hooks/hooks/hooks.json` |
| Hook common utilities | Parse hook input, collect normalized edited file paths, find language project roots, parse env flags, and emit hook responses. | `plugins/*-lang-hooks/scripts/common/hook.mjs` |
| C++ post-edit hook | Deduplicates edited C/C++ paths, formats existing files, runs configurable `clang-tidy`, and marks turn state. | `plugins/cpp-lang-hooks/scripts/post_edit_hook.mjs` |
| C++ stop hook | Runs configurable `cmake --build` and `ctest` checks for CMake projects only when state says the current turn changed C/C++ files. | `plugins/cpp-lang-hooks/scripts/stop_hook.mjs` |
| C++ turn state | Stores per-turn C/C++ change flags in SQLite under `PLUGIN_DATA`. | `plugins/cpp-lang-hooks/scripts/common/turn_state.mjs` |
| Rust post-edit hook | Formats affected Cargo projects with `cargo fmt`, formats standalone `.rs` files with `rustfmt`, and marks turn state. | `plugins/rust-lang-hooks/scripts/post_edit_hook.mjs` |
| Rust stop hook | Runs configurable `cargo check`, strict `cargo clippy -- -D warnings`, and `cargo test` for affected Cargo projects. | `plugins/rust-lang-hooks/scripts/stop_hook.mjs` |
| Rust turn state | Stores per-turn Rust change flags and affected Cargo project directories in SQLite under `PLUGIN_DATA`. | `plugins/rust-lang-hooks/scripts/common/turn_state.mjs` |

## Data Flow

1. A Codex edit tool triggers the C++ plugin `PostToolUse` hook.
2. `collectHookFilePaths()` extracts edited paths from `tool_input` or `apply_patch` content.
3. Paths are normalized and deduplicated; any mentioned C/C++ path records the turn as changed for `input.turn_id`.
4. Existing changed C/C++ files are formatted when enabled. `clang-tidy` runs on source files by default, with header tidy opt-in through `CPP_HOOKS_TIDY_HEADERS=1`.
5. A Codex `Stop` event invokes `stop_hook.mjs`.
6. The stop hook skips when disabled by env flags or when the current turn definitely has no C/C++ changes; otherwise it selects the first supported build directory, runs `cmake --build`, then runs `ctest`.

For Rust:

1. A Codex edit tool triggers the Rust plugin `PostToolUse` hook.
2. `collectHookFilePaths(input, cwd)` extracts normalized, deduplicated edited paths from `tool_input` or `apply_patch` content.
3. Any mentioned `.rs` path records the turn as Rust-changed for `input.turn_id`; paths under Cargo projects also record the nearest `Cargo.toml` directory.
4. Existing Rust files under Cargo projects are formatted once per affected project with `cargo fmt`; standalone existing `.rs` files are formatted with `rustfmt`.
5. Failed Rust formatting commands report shared command failure details, including labeled `stderr`/`stdout` when both streams exist and tail trimming controlled by `RUST_HOOKS_OUTPUT_MAX_CHARS`.
6. A Codex `Stop` event invokes the Rust stop hook.
7. Failed Rust Stop-hook Cargo commands use the same command failure detail formatter in either blocking responses or retry-mode system messages.
8. The stop hook skips when disabled by env flags, when there are no Rust changes, or when the turn only touched standalone Rust files; otherwise it runs `cargo check`, `cargo clippy -- -D warnings`, and `cargo test` in each affected Cargo project.

## Design Patterns

- Template Method style scaffolding: `create_language_hook_plugin.py` copies a fixed template and rewrites known metadata fields.
- Fail-open hook state: if `PLUGIN_DATA`, `turn_id`, or SQLite access is unavailable, the stop hook runs `ctest` rather than silently trusting missing state.
- Local host tool delegation: hooks call external language tools when installed and silently skip missing optional tools.
- Ordered CMake build discovery: hooks prefer `build/`, `cmake-build-debug/`, `cmake-build-release/`, then `out/build/` when those directories contain CMake marker files.
- Per-process hook caches: post-edit tidy checks cache nearest CMake project directories, build directory selection, and `compile_commands.json` presence during a single hook invocation.

## Security Boundaries

- Hook scripts execute local commands (`clang-format`, `clang-tidy`, `cmake`, `ctest`, `cargo`, `rustfmt`) against repository files, so they should keep arguments structured and avoid shell interpolation.
- Plugin state is stored only under `PLUGIN_DATA`; repository files are not used for runtime hook state.
- Environment flags primarily enable or disable local checks; Rust also exposes `RUST_HOOKS_OUTPUT_MAX_CHARS` to bound failed command output included in hook messages.
- The generator writes to `plugins/` and `.agents/plugins/marketplace.json`; it validates plugin names and JSON object shapes before writing.
