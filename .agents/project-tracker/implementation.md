# Implementation Details

## Entry Points

| Target | File | Purpose |
|--------|------|---------|
| Plugin generator CLI | `scripts/create_language_hook_plugin.py` | Creates a new plugin from `templates/language-hook-template/` and updates marketplace metadata. |
| C++ post-edit hook | `plugins/cpp-lang-hooks/scripts/post_edit_hook.mjs` | Processes edited C/C++ files after edit tools. |
| C++ stop hook | `plugins/cpp-lang-hooks/scripts/stop_hook.mjs` | Runs or skips `ctest` at turn stop. |
| Hook test suite | `tests/cpp-lang-hooks/stateful_hooks.test.mjs` | Exercises hook scripts through child processes. |

## Key Algorithms & Logic

- `normalize_name()` lowercases plugin names, replaces non-alphanumeric runs with `-`, trims separators, and enforces a 64-character limit.
- `collectHookFilePaths()` supports ordinary edit tool inputs and parses `apply_patch` headers, including file moves.
- `collectHookFilePaths()` keeps both source and destination paths for moves, allowing deleted or moved-away C/C++ files to mark a turn as changed.
- `findCMakeBuildDir()` searches `build/`, `cmake-build-debug/`, `cmake-build-release/`, and `out/build/`, choosing the first directory with CMake marker files.
- `runClangTidy()` finds the nearest `CMakeLists.txt`, then uses the selected build directory when it contains `compile_commands.json`.
- `markCppChanged()` upserts `cpp_changed = 1` for a turn in SQLite.
- `didCppChange()` returns `true` for known C++ changes, `false` for known no-change rows/missing rows, and `null` when state cannot be trusted.
- `stop_hook.mjs` skips CMake checks only on a definite `false`; otherwise it runs `cmake --build` before `ctest` when a supported build directory is found.

## Error Handling Strategy

- Hook scripts emit blocking JSON when a required command fails.
- Missing `clang-format`, `clang-tidy`, `cmake`, or `ctest` binaries are treated as non-blocking.
- Shared hook errors are logged to `${PLUGIN_DATA}/hook_errors.log` when possible.
- SQLite failures are swallowed by state helpers and represented as `false` or `null`, so hooks keep developer flow moving.
- The Python generator raises explicit errors for invalid plugin names, invalid JSON shapes, missing templates, or duplicate target directories.

## Testing Strategy

| Test level | Location | What it covers |
|------------|----------|----------------|
| Hook integration | `tests/cpp-lang-hooks/stateful_hooks.test.mjs` | Post-edit state marking, deleted/moved C++ paths, build directory selection, stop-hook build/test decisions, missing `turn_id`, and missing `PLUGIN_DATA`. |
| Manual syntax | N/A | `node --check` for hook scripts and tests. |
| Generator smoke | N/A | Not currently covered by automated tests. |

## Performance Considerations

- The stateful stop hook avoids running CMake build/test commands on turns without C/C++ edits.
- SQLite connections are opened per state operation and closed immediately, keeping hook code simple and isolated.
- Hook file detection filters to known C/C++ extensions before invoking external tooling.
