## Key Algorithms & Logic

- `normalize_name()` lowercases plugin names, replaces non-alphanumeric runs with `-`, trims separators, and enforces a 64-character limit.
- `collectHookFilePaths(input, cwd)` supports ordinary edit tool inputs and parses `apply_patch` headers, including file moves.
- `collectHookFilePaths(input, cwd)` resolves relative paths against `cwd`, normalizes paths, and deduplicates equivalent path strings before callers filter by language extension.
- `collectHookFilePaths()` keeps both source and destination paths for moves, allowing deleted or moved-away C/C++ files to mark a turn as changed.
- C++ `post_edit_hook.mjs` filters normalized C/C++ paths before running tools, so equivalent paths like `main.cpp` and `./main.cpp` are processed once.
- C++ source extensions (`.c`, `.cc`, `.cpp`, `.cxx`) and header extensions (`.h`, `.hh`, `.hpp`) are tracked separately; headers are formatted by default but only tidied when `CPP_HOOKS_TIDY_HEADERS=1`.
- `findCMakeBuildDir()` searches `build/`, `cmake-build-debug/`, `cmake-build-release/`, and `out/build/`, choosing the first directory with CMake marker files.
- `runClangTidy()` finds the nearest `CMakeLists.txt`, then uses the selected build directory when it contains `compile_commands.json`; these lookups are cached for the duration of one hook process.
- `envFlag()` and `envEnabled()` parse `CPP_HOOKS_*` flags; only `"1"` explicitly enables opt-in flags and only `"0"` explicitly disables default-on checks.
- `envInt()` parses positive integer environment values and falls back to the caller's default when unset, invalid, or non-positive.
- Rust and Python `commandFailureDetails()` helpers format failed command output, prefer process errors, preserve both `stderr` and `stdout` with labels when both exist, fall back to exit status when output is empty, and trim long output to the configured tail.
- `markCppChanged()` upserts `cpp_changed = 1` for a turn in SQLite.
- `didCppChange()` returns `true` for known C++ changes, `false` for known no-change rows/missing rows, and `null` when state cannot be trusted.
- `stop_hook.mjs` skips CMake checks when `CPP_HOOKS_CTEST=0`, when `CPP_HOOKS_FAST=1`, or on a definite no-change state; otherwise it runs `cmake --build` before `ctest` when a supported build directory is found.
- Rust `post_edit_hook.mjs` filters normalized `.rs` paths, records any Rust edit for turn state, and records nearest Cargo project directories when a `Cargo.toml` ancestor exists.
- Rust post-edit formatting uses `cargo fmt` once per affected Cargo project and `rustfmt` for existing standalone `.rs` files outside Cargo projects.
- Rust `stop_hook.mjs` runs enabled Cargo commands in order: `cargo check`, `cargo clippy -- -D warnings`, then `cargo test`.
- Failed Rust post-edit and Stop-hook command messages share `commandFailureDetails()` so blocking reasons and retry-mode system messages have the same output trimming and stream labeling.
- `RUST_HOOKS_CARGO_FMT`, `RUST_HOOKS_RUSTFMT`, `RUST_HOOKS_CARGO_CHECK`, `RUST_HOOKS_CARGO_CLIPPY`, `RUST_HOOKS_CARGO_TEST`, and `RUST_HOOKS_FAST` control Rust hook behavior.
- `RUST_HOOKS_OUTPUT_MAX_CHARS` controls how much failed Rust command output is included in hook messages; invalid values fall back to 4000 characters.
- Rust stop checks fail open to the current Cargo project when turn state is unavailable; known standalone-only Rust edits skip Stop Cargo checks.
- Python `post_edit_hook.mjs` treats `.py`, `.pyi`, and known Python config filenames as Python changes for turn state.
- Python post-edit formatting applies only to existing `.py` and `.pyi` files, using formatter priority `ruff format`, `isort` plus `black`, then `yapf`.
- Python project root discovery uses markers such as `pyproject.toml`, `setup.cfg`, `setup.py`, test configs, type-checker configs, and Ruff/Pylint configs, falling back to the path's containing directory.
- Python command resolution searches upward for `.venv`, `venv`, `.env`, or `env`, prefers executable tools inside that virtualenv, and falls back to global `PATH`.
- Python helper caches memoize nearest project roots, nearest virtualenvs, global `PATH` command lookups, and resolved `(command, startDir)` results for one hook process.
- `markPythonChanged()` upserts `python_changed = 1` for a turn and records affected Python project roots in SQLite.
- `getPythonTurnState()` returns known Python changes and project roots, known no-change state, or `null` when state cannot be trusted.
- Python `stop_hook.mjs` runs enabled Stop commands in order: first available type checker (`ty`, `pyre`, `pyright`, `mypy`), first available linter (`ruff check`, `pylint`), then first available test runner (`pytest`, `python -m unittest discover`).
- Python normal Stop mode blocks on the first failed command, while retry mode runs all checks for all affected project roots and returns a combined `systemMessage` for every failure.
- `PYTHON_HOOKS_FORMAT`, `PYTHON_HOOKS_TYPECHECK`, `PYTHON_HOOKS_LINT`, `PYTHON_HOOKS_TEST`, and `PYTHON_HOOKS_FAST` control Python hook behavior.
- `PYTHON_HOOKS_OUTPUT_MAX_CHARS` controls how much failed Python command output is included in hook messages; invalid values fall back to 4000 characters.
- JS/TS `post_edit_hook.mjs` treats `.js`, `.mjs`, `.cjs`, `.jsx`, `.ts`, `.mts`, `.cts`, `.tsx`, and tracked JS/TS config files as JS changes for turn state.
- JS/TS post-edit formatting applies only to existing code files, using formatter priority `prettier --write` then `biome format --write`.
- JS/TS post-edit processing also records touched existing code files in SQLite so Stop-hook direct lint fallbacks can operate on file arguments instead of `.`.
- JS/TS project root discovery uses nearest `package.json`, TS/JS config files, Biome/ESLint/Prettier/Vitest/Jest configs, and common lockfiles; standalone formatting falls back to the path's containing directory.
- JS/TS command resolution searches upward for the nearest `node_modules/.bin`, prefers local executables there, and falls back to global `PATH`.
- JS/TS helper caches memoize nearest project roots, package manager detection, package script presence, malformed `package.json` parse state, local bin directories, global `PATH` command lookups, and resolved `(command, startDir)` results for one hook process.
- `markJsChanged()` upserts `js_changed = 1` for a turn and records affected JS/TS project roots plus touched existing code files in SQLite.
- `getJsTurnState()` returns known JS changes, project roots, and lint-file paths, known no-change state, or `null` when state cannot be trusted.
- JS/TS `stop_hook.mjs` blocks on malformed discovered `package.json` content before command selection, then runs enabled Stop commands in order: package-script-first `typecheck`, `lint`, and `test`, then direct fallbacks `tsc --noEmit`, touched-file `eslint` / `biome check`, and `vitest run` / `jest --runInBand` / `node --test`.
- When `PLUGIN_DATA` state is unavailable, JS/TS Stop hooks still fail open for root-scoped checks, but direct-tool lint fallback is suppressed because touched-file state is unavailable.
- JS/TS normal Stop mode blocks on the first failed command, while retry mode runs all checks for all affected project roots and returns a combined `systemMessage` for every failure.
- `JS_HOOKS_FORMAT`, `JS_HOOKS_TYPECHECK`, `JS_HOOKS_LINT`, `JS_HOOKS_TEST`, and `JS_HOOKS_FAST` control JS/TS hook behavior.
- `JS_HOOKS_OUTPUT_MAX_CHARS` controls how much failed JS/TS command output is included in hook messages; invalid values fall back to 4000 characters.

## Error Handling Strategy

- Hook scripts emit blocking JSON when a required command fails.
- Rust, Python, and JS/TS required-tool failures include bounded command details so large stdout/stderr payloads do not flood hook responses.
- Missing `clang-format`, `clang-tidy`, `cmake`, `ctest`, `cargo`, or `rustfmt` binaries are treated as non-blocking.
- Missing JS/TS tools such as `prettier`, `biome`, `eslint`, `tsc`, `vitest`, `jest`, or a package manager are treated as non-blocking fallbacks to the next candidate or category skip.
- Disabled checks return successful hook output without invoking their corresponding host tools.
- Shared hook errors are logged to `${PLUGIN_DATA}/hook_errors.log` when possible.
- SQLite failures are swallowed by state helpers and represented as `false` or `null`, so hooks keep developer flow moving.
- The Python generator raises explicit errors for invalid plugin names, invalid JSON shapes, missing templates, or duplicate target directories.

## Testing Strategy

| Test level | Location | What it covers |
|------------|----------|----------------|
| Cross-language aggregation | `tests/all.test.mjs` | Loads each language suite and asserts every plugin `scripts/common/hook.mjs` still matches the template copy exactly. |
| C++ hook integration | `tests/cpp-lang-hooks/post_edit_state.test.mjs`, `tests/cpp-lang-hooks/post_edit_tools.test.mjs`, `tests/cpp-lang-hooks/stop_hook.test.mjs` | Post-edit state marking, deleted/moved C++ paths, path dedupe, header tidy defaults, env toggles, build directory selection, stop-hook build/test decisions, missing `turn_id`, and missing `PLUGIN_DATA`. |
| Rust hook integration | `tests/rust-lang-hooks/post_edit.test.mjs`, `tests/rust-lang-hooks/stop_hook.test.mjs`, `tests/rust-lang-hooks/failure_output.test.mjs` | Cargo-project and standalone Rust formatting, deleted Rust paths, path/project dedupe, env toggles, strict Clippy stop checks, stop-hook Cargo command decisions, long output trimming, both-stream labeling, retry-mode messages, and empty-output exit-status fallback. |
| Python hook integration | `tests/python-lang-hooks/post_edit_detection.test.mjs`, `tests/python-lang-hooks/post_edit_formatting.test.mjs`, `tests/python-lang-hooks/python_runtime.test.mjs`, `tests/python-lang-hooks/retry_and_output.test.mjs`, `tests/python-lang-hooks/stop_hook.test.mjs` | Python formatting, `.pyi` and config change detection, formatter priority, virtualenv preference, Stop command selection, env toggles, retry aggregation, command-resolution memoization, and bounded failure-output reporting. |
| JS/TS hook integration | `tests/js-lang-hooks/post_edit_detection.test.mjs`, `tests/js-lang-hooks/post_edit_formatting.test.mjs`, `tests/js-lang-hooks/node_runtime.test.mjs`, `tests/js-lang-hooks/retry_and_output.test.mjs`, `tests/js-lang-hooks/stop_hook.test.mjs` | JS/TS formatting, config change detection, formatter priority, local `node_modules/.bin` preference, package-manager and package-script detection, malformed `package.json` blocking behavior, touched-file lint state persistence, file-scoped Stop lint selection, env toggles, retry aggregation, standalone-file skip logic, and bounded failure-output reporting. |
| Shared test helpers | `tests/*/helpers.mjs`, `tests/shared/runtime.mjs`, `tests/shared/sqlite.mjs` | Fixture creation, fake tool wiring, hook spawning, and SQLite state inspection. |
| Manual syntax | N/A | `node --check` for hook scripts and tests. |
| Generator smoke | N/A | Not currently covered by automated tests. |

## Performance Considerations

- The stateful stop hook avoids running CMake build/test commands on turns without C/C++ edits.
- `CPP_HOOKS_FAST=1` skips `clang-tidy` and Stop-hook CMake/CTest checks while keeping formatting.
- Post-edit CMake project discovery, build directory selection, and `compile_commands.json` checks are cached within each hook process.
- SQLite connections are opened per state operation and closed immediately, keeping hook code simple and isolated.
- Hook file detection filters and deduplicates known C/C++ paths before invoking external tooling.
- Rust Stop checks only run for affected Cargo projects, avoiding `cargo check`/`clippy`/`test` for turns that only touch standalone Rust files.
- Rust failure output is capped to the last 4000 characters by default, or to the positive integer configured in `RUST_HOOKS_OUTPUT_MAX_CHARS`.
- Python Stop checks only run for affected Python project roots, avoiding typecheck/lint/test work on turns without Python code or config changes.
- Python formatter and Stop command resolution caches avoid repeated upward virtualenv/project-root walks and repeated global `PATH` scans within one hook process.
- Python failure output is capped to the last 4000 characters by default, or to the positive integer configured in `PYTHON_HOOKS_OUTPUT_MAX_CHARS`.
- JS/TS Stop checks only run for affected JS/TS project roots, avoiding typecheck/lint/test work on turns without tracked JS/TS code or config changes.
- JS/TS direct-tool lint fallbacks now operate on touched files instead of `.` to reduce Stop latency for large projects.
- JS/TS runtime caches avoid repeated upward project-root walks, package-manager/script inspection, local `node_modules/.bin` discovery, and repeated global `PATH` scans within one hook process.
- JS/TS failure output is capped to the last 4000 characters by default, or to the positive integer configured in `JS_HOOKS_OUTPUT_MAX_CHARS`.
